    <h1>More CSS Basics! It's stylin' time.</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>Wednesday June 8th, 2022. <br>Day three of coding.</h3>
    <p>It is finally time to get to the exciting part of web design, implimenting CSS into HTML.    </p>
    <p> <strong>External CSS</strong> (the most commonly used method) is created in a separate file and is added within the '<em>head</em>' tags of the HTML, it uses a self-closing '<em>link</em>' tag. This method is good when a website has many pages that share the same style.</p>
    <p><strong>Internal CSS (or embedded CSS)</strong> is created within the HTML file itself within the '<em>head</em>' tags, they use opening and closing '<em>style</em>' tags. This method is useful a page that will have a different style (Note, depending on the amount of rules and declarations, this will make the HTML quite large).</p>
    <p><strong>Inline CSS</strong> is used to add styles directly to HMTL elements using the '<em>style="attribute: value;"</em>'. This method is not recommended often because it could get a bit messy by bloating the HTML. You also run the risk of CSS overrifing it.</p>


    <h2>CSS Foundations</h2>
    <p>I'm going to add an external CSS stylesheet to this page and play around with it, eventually we'll make a nicer looking one to the index and future pages. 
    <br>To add, we're going to include <em>[link rel="stylesheet href="style003.css"]</em></p>
        <br>

<div id="fun">
    <p>To see what I've learned today, check out the css code! It was mostly behind-the-scenes</p>
         <p>Like how to resize an image:</p>
            <img class="resize" src="images/llama.jpg" alt="llama">
        <div class="box">
            <p>Or how to add a fun box! <br>
            And to use <br>
                '<em>br</em>'<br>   
                To add space between text</p>
            </div>   
            <p>and how to add a hover effect to links:</p>    
        </div>
       

    <div class="centered">
        <a href="day002.html">Day 2</a>  |  <a href="index.html">Return to Index</a>  |  <a href="day004.html">Day 4</a>
    </div>
