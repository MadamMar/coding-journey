    <h2>Wednesday June 8th, 2022. Day three of coding.</h2>
    <p>It is finally time to get to the exciting part of web design, implimenting CSS into HTML.    </p>
    <p> <strong>External CSS</strong> (the most commonly used method) is created in a separate file and is added within the '<em>head</em>' tags of the HTML, it uses a self-closing '<em>link</em>' tag. This method is good when a website has many pages that share the same style.</p>
    <p><strong>Internal CSS (or embedded CSS)</strong> is created within the HTML file itself within the '<em>head</em>' tags, they use opening and closing '<em>style</em>' tags. This method is useful a page that will have a different style (Note, depending on the amount of rules and declarations, this will make the HTML quite large).</p>
    <p><strong>Inline CSS</strong> is used to add styles directly to HMTL elements using the '<em>style="attribute: value;"</em>'. This method is not recommended often because it could get a bit messy by bloating the HTML. You also run the risk of CSS overrifing it.</p>
