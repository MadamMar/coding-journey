    <h1>Jumping into HTML!</h1>
    <h2>Monday June 6th, 2022. Day one of coding.</h2>

    <p>I am now on my fourth day of Odin Project and I am finally starting the HTML basics. Very basic!
        I thought the best way to put my knowledge to the test and use everything I learn was to create a little journal site. 
        It should be a fun way to display my knowledge and commit new skills to memory.
        So let's do it! 
        (It will be neat to see the look of this "site" evolve, especially as we learn some CSS to class the place up)
    </p>
    <p> Using multiple paragraph tags will split up the text nicely! And they do not need to be numbered, oops.</p>
    <p> We can also make <strong>Bold text</strong> using the "strong" tags.</p>
    <p> For cute <em>Italic text</em>, we can use the "em" tags. Let's try <strong><em>using them together!</em></strong></p>
    <p> All of these paragraphs I am putting together are considered <em>nesting</em> because they are sharing the same <strong>body</strong>. 
        In other words, they share a <em>parent</em> within the same <strong>body</strong> tags, they are the <em>children</em>.
    The <strong>paragraph</strong> tags are considered <em>siblings</em>.</p>

    <h3><strong>Now for Lists!</strong> <em>Unordered + Ordered.</em></h3>
    <h4>List #1, <em>Unordered:</em></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Here we used the <strong>ul</strong> <em>parent</em> tags with the <strong>li</strong> tags nestled inside.</p>
    <h4> List #2, <em>Ordered:</em></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Here we instead used the <strong>ol</strong> <em>parent</em> tags with the <strong>li</strong> tags nestled inside. </p>

    <h3>Links and Images</h3>
    <h4>Links:</h4>
    <p> Using the <strong>a (anchor)</strong> tags, along with 'href="a url to link here"'(<em>Fun Fact: href stands for hypertext reference</em>). Let's try a link to <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a> now.</p>
    <p>There are two different types of URLs to link. 
        The first, <strong>Absolute Links</strong>, link to pages on other websites. They must contain the protocol like in the link used above(example: https) 
        The second, <strong>Relative Links</strong>, link to pages within our website. They do not include a protocol, they include the file path to the other page relative to the one created.
        We can also use the "anchor" tags for more than URLs. They can also linke to videos, pdfs, images, etc.</p>
        <p> Now let's try linking to tomorrow's page; <a href="day002.html">My Coding Journey: Day 2</a></p>
        <h4>Images:</h4>
        <p>Using the <strong>img (image)</strong> tags, along with 'src="url to image here"'. (Note: images don't need a closing tag)</p>
        <p> Let's put an image from our Image folder here:</p>
        <center><img src="images/secure-coding.png"></center>
        <p>It is also helpful to add a text alternative to an image. It is useful for if an image can't load, it will show a description instead. To do this, add an "alt" attribute after the src path.</p>
        <p> Ex) [img src="broken.jpg" alt="(The image won't appear, but this text will.)"]</p>
        <center><img src="broken.jpg" alt="(The image won't appear, but this text will.)"></center>
    
        <h3> Commit Messages</h3>
        <p> Commit messages are notes only seen in the code. They are beneficial when working alone on a project or with a group.
            They will only been seen in code and are a good reminder of where you left off, when you change something or for any reason that a note would be helpful for your future self or team members working on the same project to communicate changes and/or plans.</p>
            <p> Think of commit messages like a "snapshot" of your code at the moment the commit was made.</p>
            <p>It is considers best practice to commit every time you have a meaningful change in the code. This creates a timeline of progress.</p>
            <h4>Some examples of when to make a commit:</h2>
            <ul> 
                <li>Fixing a typo</li>
                <li>Fixing a bug</li>
                <li>When working on making a function work the way you want it to</li>
                <li>When you get that function to work!</li>
                <li>To give context to a change to fellow developers, or to your future self</li>
            </ul>

            <p> A well formed dedication to commit messages will ensure a site or project will be easier to maintain for extended periods of time.</p>

            <h4>The Seven Rules of a great Git commit message:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Separate subject from body with a blank like</li>
                <li>Limit the subject like to 50 characters</li>
                <li>Capitalize the subject line</li>
                <li>Do not end the subject line with a period</li>
                <li>Use the imperative mood in the subject line</li>
                <li>Wrap the body at 72 characters</li>
                <li>Use the body to explain <em>what</em> and <em>why</em> vs. <em>how</em></li>
            </ol>

            <p> Lastly, the commit message will be written in the command line of shell. Ex) git commit -m "Add my first commit"</p>
            <p>A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If applied, this commit will <em>your subject line here</em></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If applied, this commit will <strong>Add my first commit</strong></li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
