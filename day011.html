    <h1>Foundations of JavaScript</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>Tuesday June 28th + 30th, 2022<br>Day Eleven</h3>

    <p><strong>Small Update:</strong> 
    <br><span class="small">We are a little bit past Day11, I spent a couple of days working on the <a href="https://smexch.github.io/landing-page/">Landing Page</a> project and it turned out quite well. I will probably customize it further or create something new using the template. 
        <br>Anyway, onto JavaScript!</span></p>

    <h2>How to Run JavaScript Code</h2>
    <p>The simplest way to run JavaScript is within the browser, we'll simply create an HTML file with the JavaScript code inside of it. Just add <span class="special-text">[style]</span> tags within the head of the code, within write <span class="special-text">[console.log("Hello, World!")]</span>
    <br> Anything placed within the ( ) will print to the developer console in the browser.</p>
    <p>To include JavaScript within an external script, it is similar to linking external CSS (as I have been doing thus far). Add <span class="special-text"> [script src="javascript.js"]  [/script] </span>. The .js extension works like .css for stylesheets</p> 

    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <p>A variable is a "named storage" that is used to store all kinds of data/information. To create a variable in JavaScript, use the keyword <span class="special-text">let</span>.
    <br> An example of how <span class="special-text">let</span> works: 
    <br>1 <span class="special-text">let</span> message;  <em>(creats/declares a variable with the name "message")</em>
    <br>2 message = "Hello"; <em>(store the string "Hello" in the variable named "message". It is the data/info)</em>
    <br>3 alert(message); <em>(shows the variable content)</em>
    <br>(Line 1 and 2 can be combined as <em>let message = 'Hello';</em>)
    </p>
    <p>Declaring multiple variables in one line would look like this:
        <br> 1 let user = 'John', age = 25, message = 'Hello';</p>
    <p>Though  not recommended, for better readability they should be given their own lines like this:
        <br>1 <span class="special-text">let</span> user ='John';
        <br>2 <span class="special-text">let</span> age = 25;
        <br>3 <span class="special-text">let</span> message = 'Hello';
    <br> Or more simply:
        <br>1 <span class="special-text">let</span> user = 'John';
        <br>2   age = 25;
        <br>3   message = 'Hello';</p>

    <p>An easy way to think about <strong>variables</strong> is a way of organization. In the previous exmaple of message, think of a box labelled "message" (the <strong> variable</strong>) and within the box we put "Hello" (the <strong>value</strong>).
    <br> A variable should only be declared once (using <span class="special-text">let</span>) and from then on, it should only be used without being declared.</p>
        
<h2>Variable Naming</h2>
<p><strong>2 Rules of naming:</strong>
    <br> The name must contain only letters, digits or the $ and _ symbols.
    <br>The first character must not be a digit</p>
<p>When naming a Variable with more than one word, capitalize the beginning of each word (except for the first) like so: thisWordyVariableName
    <br>Variables are cast sensitive, you can also use any language/alphabet/hieroglyphs/cyrillic letters.
    <br>Some words are reserved and cannot be used as variable names, such as <em>'let', 'class', 'return', 'function'.</em>
</p>

<p><strong>Constants</strong>        
    <br>To make a variable unchangable, declare it a constant using <span class="special-text">const</span> instead of <span class="special-text">let</span>.
    <br>These variables cannot be reassigned. This communicates clearly that the value will never change (example, a birthday is always the same date)
    <br>Constants (which are generally done in uppercase to stand out for a decided value) are useful to simplify a value that is difficult to remember, like with colors. Example:
    <br><span class="special-text">const</span> COLOR_ORANGE = "#FF7F00";
    <br>COLOR_ORANGE is much easier to remember than the hexidecimal format and harder to misstype, especially if you'll be cycling through many different colors.
</p>
    <p> When values are constant but are calculated in run-time, but don't change after the initial assignment, we do not use all uppercase. Example:
    <br><span class="special-text">const</span> pageLoadTime =
    <br> Simply put, capital named constants are only used as aliases for "hard-coded" values.
</p>    

<p><strong>Naming Summed up</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Names should be clean and clear for what is stored inside. It should be easy for another coder to see and understand easily.</li>
    <li>They should be easily readable like userName, shoppingCart</li>
    <li>Avoid abbreviations </li>
    <li> Create new variables for new things as opposed to always reusing the old ones. This will help in situations where debugging is required and is just more organized.</li>
    </ul>
